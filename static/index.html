				Habitica week at a glance
			</h1>
			<p>
				Habitica week at a glance is a tool that displays your Dailies and ToDo's from <a href="http://www.habitica.com" target="_blank">Habitica</a> in a week overview calendar format.
				<br>
				The first thing you should do is go to the <a href="/settings">settings page</a> and put in your HabitRPG user token and key.
				<br>
				This was created for personal use, so it's probably buggy and insecure. Use at your own risk.
